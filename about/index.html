          <p class="lead">Ever since I got my first computer in the early 2000's, I began learning how they
            worked. While I may have broken a couple of them (and making my dad quite upset) during my self-teachings, the books I read (to expand my understanding of these wonderful machines), at that time, where not sufficient. When I first surfed the internet (and yes, when AOL was very popular), my knowledge of computers increased and I eventually taught myself a bit of HTML and CSS. Little did I know the road that was waiting ahead for me.

          <p class="lead"> The Computer Science Department at San Jose State University (as of 2014) mainly uses Java as its programming language. While I may have really enjoyed this language during my first semesters, I began to be aware of other languages. While attending this higher institution, I was introduced to UNIX Systems, how to use the terminal, and learned many languages I have never heard of. Computers simply keep amazing me.</p>

          <p class="lead">In the fall semester of 2013, in my Compiler Design course, my group and I created
            JabbaScrypt: A very simple, light-weight procedural programming language. As of this moment, this has been
            my best programming project yet. Not only is creating a compiler interesting, but making a new language
            is just... well, it fills me up with joy! I am now currently waiting for my first opportunity as a professional
            Computer Programmer / Software Engineer. </p>
